"""Media servers (Plex for now), and what they can tell us about a channel start.

Dispatcharr can see how long it took to hand the first video to a media server, but not what
the server did with it afterwards. Plex can: every playing stream says whether it is being
transcoded, how fast, and whether the player is still buffering. That last one is the gap a
viewer actually feels, so after a channel start on a media server we watch its sessions for a
short while and add what we find to the start on the Diagnostics page.

Nothing here is on the path of a stream: it runs in the background, everything is wrapped, and
a server that is unreachable simply adds nothing. The token is stored like an M3U password:
write-only in the API, never sent back to the browser.
